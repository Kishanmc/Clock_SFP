# Clock_SFP
It's my small frontend project

Welcome to my first small front-end project! This repository contains the code for a Digital Clock that displays the current time dynamically in a visually appealing design. This project helped me explore the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ•’ **Project Overview**
The digital clock is a simple yet elegant design that:

Dynamically updates the time every second.
Displays hours, minutes, and seconds in a 12-hour format with AM/PM.
Includes a neon glow effect to enhance the visual appearance.

ðŸ’¡**Features**

Real-time clock functionality using JavaScript.
Glowing digital design with CSS text-shadow and box-shadow effects.
Responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes.
Minimalistic and modern black background theme.

ðŸŽ¯ **Lessons Learned**
Through this project, I:

Gained confidence in working with basic web development tools.
Learned how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
Explored CSS properties like text-shadow and box-shadow for creative designs.
Practiced integrating different technologies to build a complete front-end project.
